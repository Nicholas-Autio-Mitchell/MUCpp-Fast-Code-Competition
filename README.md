# MUCpp-Fast-Code-Competition
During a MUC++ Meetup in Munich, particpants had one hour to create a program to handle incoming tasks in a sequential order, using threading, without blocking the tasks.

The all teams apart from ours used C++, their benchmark test results were about 30 seconds.
My team used Python, finished much earlier than the other teams, but had a benchmark result of approx. 6 minutes.

This goes to show that Python cannot compete in realms where execution time is king. It can however drastically reduce the required development time to a working solution.
